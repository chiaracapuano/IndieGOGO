    "\n",
    "The strategy consists in:\n",
    "1. collecting a series of campaign ads from the IndieGOGO website,\n",
    "2. extracting the terms frequency in the ads corpus using a TD-IDF vectorizer,\n",
    "3. training a logistic regression classifier using the corpus terms as features and the success of a campaign as label (0 if unsuccessful, 1 if successful),\n",
    "4. using the model to determine whether a campaign (chosen by the user) will be successful or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The campaign dataset is created scraping the IndieGOGO website with BeautifulSoup and Selenium. A future version of the app will only use BeautifulSoup, as it will rely on the page json file (more details below).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, we connect to the Postgres database that contains the campaign dataset.\n",
    "The dataset is dumped in a pandas dataframe, and contains three columns: the first two are the two sections of the campaign corpus identified, the last is the percentage of money collected by the campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually the campaign ads contain an \"Overview\" section that is stored in the column \"lower_case_span\" and the actual ad corpus contained in \"lower_case_div\".\n",
    "A lot of the websites scraped did not contain an overview section, therefore a lot of the respective rows are empty."
